## Documentation/Wiki

SS14's [docs site](https://docs.spacestation14.com/) has documentation on SS14's content, engine, game design, and more.
Additionally, see these resources for license and attribution information:

- [Robust Station Image](https://docs.spacestation14.com/en/specifications/robust-station-image.html)

## Contributing

This is a very low maintainence fork. All contributions and efforts you want to contribute to us would probably fare better with our upstream, Impstation. We'll get the content anyways, as we merge all content on a monthly basis.

Should you want to contribute anyways, just be sure to follow common sense practices. No web edits, make sure that code works (as-in, compiles, and performs the intended tasks it is coded to perform,) and make sure the content does not contain any low quality, illegal, or bigoted content.

## AI-generated contributions disclaimer

This project does not accept low-effort or wholesale AI-generated contributions. Examples include, but are not limited to:

- Any code (including yaml) generated by tools like GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, or similar.
- AI-created artwork, sound files, or other assets.
- Auto-generated documentation, issue reports or pull request descriptions.

Exceptions to this are simple tools like Rider's single-line completion feature.
