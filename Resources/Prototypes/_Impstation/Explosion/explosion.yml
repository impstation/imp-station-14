# Note that for every explosion type you define, explosions & nukes will start performing worse
# You should only define a new explopsion type if you really need to

# Beck here. I'm defining a new explosion type because I think it'll be a useful one to have.
# Also I had a conversation with PJB about it today (10/12/25) in which it seemed like she'd be
# prioritizing refactoring the explosion system at some point soon to have a lower performance impact
# from new explosion types.
# In the meantime, adding one custom explosion type has minimal performance impact.
# IF EXPLOSIONS START CAUSING LAG, we should remove this first.
