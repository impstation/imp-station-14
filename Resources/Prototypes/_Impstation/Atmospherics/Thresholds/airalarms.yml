# Threshold prototypes for AtmosMonitors

# NOTE: Warning thresholds are given as multipliers of the danger bound. For
# example, if upperBound=10 (kPa) and upperWarnRound=0.5, that means the upper
# warning threshold is actually 5 (kPa).
#
# As a result, all upperWarn's should be <1 and lowerWarn's should be >1,
# otherwise the warning will never kick in.

# For gas concentrations, threshold=0.1 means 10%
# this is a copy of stationOxygen
