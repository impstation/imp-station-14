analysis-console-bias-button-info-shallow = Sets the bias an artifact has in moving between its nodes. - Depth heads toward zero depth.
analysis-console-bias-button-info-deep-random = Sets the bias an artifact has in moving between its nodes. + Depth heads toward ever-higher depths. Selecting randomly between nodes, weighted to locked nodes.
analysis-console-bias-button-info-deep-left = Sets the bias an artifact has in moving between its nodes. Left + Depth heads toward ever-higher depths. Selects the leftmost node.
analysis-console-bias-button-info-deep-right = Sets the bias an artifact has in moving between its nodes. Right + Depth heads toward ever-higher depths. Selects the rightmost node.
