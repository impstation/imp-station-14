heretic-ascension-ash =
    The old Watch is dead, the Nightwatcher burned with it. Yet his fire burns evermore,
    for the Nightwatcher brought forth the formulae to mankind! His gaze continues, as now I am one with the flames,
    WITNESS MY ASCENSION, THE EIGHTH SUN BLAZES WITH THE FURY OF THE FORGE!

heretic-ascension-blade =
    The Torn Champion is freed! I will become the blade reunited, and with my greater ambition,
    I AM UNMATCHED! A STORM OF STEEL AND SILVER IS UPON US! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-lock =
    The Stewards guided me, and I guided them.
    My foes were the Locks and my blades were the Key!
    The Labyrinth will be Locked no more, and freedom will be ours! WITNESS US!

heretic-ascension-flesh =
    With the Doe's hunger, my power has peaked. The throne is open to claim.
    People of this world, hear me, for the time has come! The Grail guides my army!
    Reality will bend to THE LORD OF THE NIGHT or be unraveled! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-void =
    The world falls into silence. I stand in an empty plane, small flakes of ice fall from the sky.
    The Aristocrat stands before me, beckoning. We will play a waltz to the whispers of dying reality,
    as the world is destroyed before our eyes. The void will return all to nothing. WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-rust =
    Champion of rust. Corruptor of steel. Fear the dark, for the RUSTBRINGER has come!
    The Blacksmith forges ahead! Rusted Hills, CALL MY NAME! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!

heretic-ascension-hunt =
    The cycle has come and gone. The Warden runs no longer, and I follow in its path.
    The day will eventually come when the tide of war shifts. But until then, I am victorious.
    I AM A HUNTER, AND YOU ARE ALL MY PREY! WITNESS MY ASCENSION!
