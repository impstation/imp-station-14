    Never let it be said that a butler lacks devotion. Even still, not all butlers of the galaxy are as devoted as the Exploding Butlers of the Sirs Collective. Little is known of the origin or operations of the Sirs Collective, but it can be said that they are a religious order. All walks of service—retired valets, disgraced ladies-in-waiting, butlers who outlive their masters, groundskeepers for properties long-sold—are welcome to join.
    The Sirs' beliefs are similar to that of a warrior: A valiant death buttling produces a prosperous afterlife in Butler Heaven. Outsiders know little of this mythological place. It is said that entries are greeted at the gates by a powerful figure named Jeevesus. A great deal of Butler art depicts this character with a neutral expression, offering some unknown bounty to the viewer. Whatever the bounty, it captivates the Sirs such that they enlist, waiting for years for their opportunity to be deployed. It is deemed highly honorable to be implanted with the Butler Bomb Implant.

    Regarding the specifics of "A Butler Death," scholars suggest that the explosion is not strictly required for admittance to Butler Heaven. Merely buttling sufficiently and dying at the will of their contractor is viewed favorably. No official Sirs Collective documentation agrees with such conclusions. Nor does it contradict them. A potential explanation for such confusion would need further insight into the financial situation of the Collective. Some have claimed that selling the implants and remote signallers is a secret motive to popularizing the Exploding gimmick with the Sirs, but the collective indicates that the costs merely cover the manufacturing and supply fees.

    Everything that can be said of the Butler Death aside, what of the Butler life? Their tenets of service seem largely in line with the regular responsibilities of an unexplosive butler.
    Here are some such principles:
        - A Butler shall not pursue militant acts.
        - A Butler shall strive to anticipate the needs of their master.
        - A Butler's dignity is tied to their master's, disgraceful behavior shall be avoided.
        - A Butler's personal preferences shall lie far beneath their master's.
    And so on.

    In spite of such standards, interviews with recipients of the rare Butler Care Package tell a different story. One such individual, a miner employed by an undisclosed company had this to say:
        "From the start, the situation was ████ing weird. I never asked for a butler. I don't know how she found me. She gave me some kind of cookie that didn't really taste sweet enough that I'd eat it again and some tea, which was disgusting. Not that I've ever had any before.
        I thought that I'd at least have her help me with my work, but she was surprisingly ████. Er, incompetent. She couldn't even lift a pickaxe. When I sent her to go bring my refined steel to distribution, it took crazy long. I asked my girl at dist what was up, and apparently the butler like struggled so much carrying the stacks that my girl met her halfway and offered to carry some for her. But her █████ ███ said no?!
        When she finally got back I asked how to send her home. I guess she said something about the instruction manual they sent me. Look. I'm a busy person. I didn't read it. She told me basically that I could press the button on this gaudy remote signaller to provide feedback, and so I did.
        And she ████ing exploded! What the ████? Do you know how long it took to clean up all the blood and guts?"

    Whether a fluke or representation, who can say?
