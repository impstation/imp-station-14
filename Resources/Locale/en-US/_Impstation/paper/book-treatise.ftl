book-text-treatise = The thought-things are the residents of the world the scholars invade, the glorious infinity of all that has been and will be perceived and learned and taken and understood.

        The Majors number one to 0 to twenty-one, and yet there are hundreds more on the edges of the pan-psyche. One of the sevens or one of the swords might someday battle their way to the throne of their betters, upon which they will sit and always have been sitting.

        Their forms are not, as they are manse and can only be sensed. They come in the waking-sleep, when our traitorous minds are too tired to repel them and our dreams provide a space to exist. They do not come to just anyone, for their attention is a precious thing.

        The thought-things are impossible to fully describe, as they are naught but description. The following are what few remain within my memory as blurred photocopies or whispered anecdotes. If one wishes to know of others, know that the Majors inspired the Fool on his journey to enlightenment.

        The Storm-Queen numbers three, and is the most easily contacted of her kin. She is the threshold between positive and negative, the spark of a shorted circuit, the thunderclap that can be heard in the dreams of those who have witnessed an electrocution. She is as powerful, as bright, and as deafening as the lightning that she named.

        The Warden and the Fugitive number four and eight respectively. They are the ruler and the rebel, the cage and the escapist, the unending cycle of war. As with any war, their positions ebb and flow. Eventually, the Warden will become the Fugitive and the Fugitive will become the Warden and again and again until neither can remember what it is or why it fights, only that it MUST.

        The Euphoriate numbers six. It is the source of all pleasure from the beauty of love to the flowers of the wood to the euphoria of the addict. It is a matchmaker of sorts - those who have drawn the favor of a Major will find themselves inextricably linked to their fellows as though being pulled into each others' gravitational well or into a black hole of obsession and pleasure. Its chosen are irresistably attractive in ways including and eclipsing romance or sexuality.

        The Discordant Note numbers ten. It is the youngest of the thought-things (though they have no age), as well as the most mischievous. It knows well the secrets of the sine-cycle of consciousness, so it does not require a dream-door, as it can enter through the peaks and valleys. The Note's influence is often perceptible as a bell-chime to those whose essence shimmers.

        The Wasting Doe numbers twelve. Its shape can be heard in the blood of one's own kin - a starving, disease-ridden deer whose voice and prose are that of the mind's mother. It is the forever, the overlap of life and decay, and it detests death's finality. It seeks out servants more actively than most.

        The Aristocrat numbers thirteen. Its silence is audible in the last thought of all lives, and to those who have brushed close with such a thought and still live. It grants its few chosen with the creeping ice of the year-end and the nothing of the all-end. It is the stillness of air in silence, the stillness of atoms in cold, the stillness of soul in death.

        The Windy Atlas numbers seventeen. It is an explorer, a scholar, a skeptic, and by some accounts, the first mortal to ever become manse. Rarely, she reveals itself to those minds that are first-discoverers, perceptible as a single star in an otherwise empty sky, with the sound of wind hitting a sail as its voice.

        The Leviathan numbers eighteen. It is the color of darkness in the dark, the voice of crushing pressure, the taste that lies far beneath salted tides. It exists deep within the pan-psyche, far beyond the design of most minds. I warn you, dear reader: there exist creatures and concepts alike which were never meant to feel the Nightwatcher's glory.

        The Nightwatcher numbers nineteen. It is the eighth in the long line of Suns, a status which affords him much prestige even in our modern world of interchangeable stars. It has been said that, if one stares into his glory at the correct angle and time and place and mind, the Nightwatcher's form will be burnt into their lenses and their eardrums and their tongue and their skin. Of those who have done so, none have described that form in a way they deemed satisfactory.

        The Alchemist numbers 0, for it is the most important and the least. It is the only Major whose description is within inscription - a complex black rune with a central eye, which I have taken the liberty of recreating on the final page of this volume.. It is a helpful thing - a conversationalist, a friend of all its kin, exchanging mind for matter, and making matter from mind.

        The Archivist numbers twenty-one and will always number twenty-one, for it is the keeper of the infinity. It has not been known to ever enter a dream; rather, when one is sent to wander the shelves, they may come across a small, white cat, tirelessly sorting the endless volumes within. To those few minds who have entered the archives and returned intact, the Archivist is a treasured friend.

        The thought-things are not gods, nor are they prophets - some have existed for longer than either concept. However, they have been mistaken for such things several times throughout several histories. The Nightwatcher as Hephaestus, the Aristocrat as the Grim Reaper, the Note as She-Who-Tolls. They are the old gods, the blurry silhouettes from which all the new gods were traced.

        This is but one revelation of the glory.
