  [color=#ffa500]Caution! This species has multiple severely limiting game mechanics.[/color]

  Allulalo are a reclusive species of sauropods native to the IMP-sector outer nebulae. They are rarely seen, preferring to conceal their cities deep inside asteroid fields and cloak their ships with stealth fields.
  
  Their small stature makes them remarkably fast on their feet, but the unusual, pentafurcated beak they use for manipulating in the place of traditional "hands" [color=#ffa500]prevents them from wielding any large weaponry.[/color] Their height also makes them unable to interface with most NT standard devices, and they can often be found [color=#ffa500]standing on chairs and tables or using anti-gravity technology to reach the controls.[/color]

  # Biology

  Allulalo do not have any abnormalities in their resistance to damage, but are [color=#ffa500]25% more vulnerable to stuns, and their low body mass causes them to be thrown farther by impacts[/color].

  It is easy to underestimate Allulalo due to these drawbacks, but they have a major strength: [color=#1e90ff]They are incredibly mobile, and can easily outpace most humanoid species[/color].

  Allulalo are also in unique posession of a highly methylated bloodstream. Due to this, [color=#1e90ff]their blood naturally evaporates on its own[/color], as well as making them [color=#1e90ff]remarkably heavyweight drinkers[/color] for their body weight.

  # Physical Strength

  Allulalo have naturally lower body mass due to their stature, and as such have difficulty dragging things larger than themselves. Their smaller size does, however, [color=#1e90ff]allow them to pilot VIMs[/color].
  Their talons, despite lacking dexterity, are capable of functioning as crude weapons, dealing slash damage.
