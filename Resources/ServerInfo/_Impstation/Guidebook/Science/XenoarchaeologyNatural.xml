  <!-- To activate and unlock nodes on an artifact, you should:
  - Check a node on the [bold]Analysis Console[/bold] to check its triggers and effects.
  - Perform the [bold]triggers[/bold] listed in the console. Some require direct interaction with the artifact, while others may only need the correct environment or a specific action performed nearby.
  - Once a trigger is successfully performed, the artifact will respond with the message: [italic]"It begins to shift in strange ways..."[/italic]. The [bold]Node Scanner[/bold] will then indicate which specific nodes are being triggered.

  Artifacts enter an unlocking state after the first trigger is met. During this state, any remaining triggers must be completed. The unlocking window initially lasts a few seconds and resets each time a new trigger is activated. This window grows longer with each additional node unlocked, giving more time to complete further triggers.

  Once all required triggers are completed successfully, the artifact will trigger it's effect and a popup will appear saying: [italic]"It slows down, visibly changed."[/italic], and the node will appear as [bold][color=plum]Active[/color][/bold] on the Console.

  If an artifact fails to activate, it will stop resonating and display the message: [italic]"It slows down before uneventfully stopping."[/italic] After this, it enters a cooldown period before it can be activated again.

  The order of trigger activation [bold]does not matter[/bold] for individual nodes. [italic]However[/italic], some triggers affect multiple nodes. As a rule of thumb, start with a trigger that is unique to the node you want to unlock. Activating a trigger for a different node during this phase prevents the target node from unlocking until the artifact’s cooldown ends. -->
