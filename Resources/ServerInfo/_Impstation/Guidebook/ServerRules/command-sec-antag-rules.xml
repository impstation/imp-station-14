  # Section D: Command, Security, Antagonist, and Silicon Rules

  Command, Security, Antagonist, and Silicon roles shape the roleplay experience of the server. These roles are subsequently held to a higher standard of roleplay, and are subject to additional rules.

  [color=#a4885c]If you are someone who frequently gets overwhelmed or stressed playing video games, please consider that Command may not be the role for you.[/color] Command is a role with many additional responsibilities, and you will be expected to facilitate roleplay for all other players.

  Free agents who choose to act like antagonists are still beholden to rules regarding escalation and antagonism.

  ## Command and Security

  [color=#a4885c]1. Your character must act in a manner that would reasonably be hired by Nanotrasen.[/color]

  Your character is presumed to be competent in their duties and able to make decisions to the benefit of the station.

  - Giving away sensitive equipment, such as a stun baton, the digiboard, or the crew monitor, is to be avoided unless there is sufficient RP justification. Examples are the recipient making a compelling argument, being bribed, or in a life or death situation. Do not hand out equipment for the purpose of metagaming efficiency.
  - Leeway is given to making deals with criminals if the deal benefits the safety or situation of the crew and station, or in the state of emergency or crisis.
  - Your competency is allowed to be compromised through escalation, such as developing paranoia regarding the crews loyalties. Thaven moods are exempt from this and can have an immediate impact upon competency.

  [color=#a4885c]2. These departments are required to read and follow Space Law and Alert Procedures to the best of their ability.[/color]

  Circumstances and context, such as being threatened by an antagonist to comply to their demands, may permit you to break laws. However, the fact that this rule is malleable is not an excuse to ignore it entirely.

  - Your character is expected to uphold the law and maintain order aboard the station. Do not engage in lawbreaking activity, and ensure all laws are followed.
  - Security is expected to intervene in criminal activity where possible.
  - Heads of departments are expected to report criminal activity to Security and should cooperate with law enforcement.

  [color=#a4885c]3. Do not hire random crew to be your bodyguard(s), or promote unqualified crewmembers to Command positions.[/color]

  If you require bodyguards or security details, talk to the Security department. If you need new Command staff, talk to the personnel in that related department.

  - Leeway is given in extreme cases where immediate assistance is needed to save yourself or the crew.
  - Do not use OOC knowledge of a particular player's qualifications to justify promoting them. Even if you know a character has played a Command role before, this should not justify promoting the character if they are playing a role without departmental qualifications, such as passenger or intern.

  [color=#a4885c]4. If you need to leave the round, let your team know.[/color]

  Notify your fellow crew and command via departmental radio and put your equipment in its proper places prior to going to cryo. If you need to leave IMMEDIATELY, please at least send an AHelp saying that you're leaving.

  - [color=#ff0000]In the absence of a Captain,[/color] a department head may choose to pick a successor and give their ID and equipment to that character.

  [color=#a4885c]5. You are expected to take lead when and where necessary.[/color]

  You are in an authority position and should provide guidance and/or assistance through giving orders and organizing crew. You should have a presence among your department, whether actively or on call for assistance. You must follow the chain of command which is based on the [textlink="current alert level." link="AlertProcedure"]

  - Orders must follow the chain of command. Heads and security officers have no jurisdiction over departments other than their own unless the alert level permits it.
  - Orders should be reasonable and within the scope of the recipient's role. Examples include ordering an engineer to renovate a room, drafting salvage for a rescue operation, and organizing service for an event.
  - Unconventional low impact station-wide orders, such as a dress code or banning a substance, are permitted.
  - Unreasonable orders are allowed to be given through RP and escalation. An unreasonable order is one that poses a risk to the recipient's life or innocents for no significant reason. Ordering them to walk into the supermatter because "she's hungry" is an unreasonable order. Ordering them to arm up for a Syndicate war declaration is not. Crew are not obligated to follow unreasonable orders.
  - Command may fire crew under their authority by confiscating gear and revoking accesses. Command and security are not exempt from being fired by someone higher in the chain of command. In the event that the captain is absent, heads can vote to fire other heads.

  Do not abuse your authority to give orders which are purposefully tedious, annoying, uncomfortable, or unfun. Consider the recipients of your orders and how it may affect their round in a positive or negative way.

  ## Antagonist

  </Box>
  [color=#a4885c]1. You should seek to make the round more engaging and fun by using antagonistic activity as a vehicle to drive the narrative of a round.[/color]

  - Succeeding at your objectives or 'greentexting' may be treated as a secondary objective. Your primary objective should be telling a story. Use your exemption from escalation, your antag tools and abilities, and roleplay to try and tell an interesting story for everyone involved.

  [color=#a4885c]2. Antagonists are free to complete their objectives through committing proportional damage. Through roleplay and escalation, damage becomes more proportional.[/color]

  - Killing players unrelated to your immediate objective in a manner that results in their round removal should be avoided. Crew that attempt to interfere with your objectives are exempt from this. Examples of interference include the paramedic attempting to rescue the body of your target, the janitor finding and reporting your secret hideout full of contraband, and security doing their job.
  - If you are concerned as to whether or not what you're about to do is allowed, feel free to AHelp for clarification. Lack of administrator response does not constitute approval.

  [color=#a4885c]3. Other antagonists are not necessarily your friends.[/color]

  Other antagonists are often solo agents that you may negotiate with at your own risk.

  - If you are a team antagonist, you must work with your partners to complete any shared objectives.
  - If you have a team leader, such as a Nuclear Operative Commander or a Head Revolutionary, you must follow their instructions unless it would result in your guaranteed death.

  [color=#a4885c]4. Purposefully using extreme tactics that have no in-round justification is strictly forbidden for all antagonists.[/color]

  - More leeway is given to station-destroying antagonists, such as nuclear operatives.
  - [color=#ff0000]The Lowpop Clause:[/color] In populations of 20 people or lower, remember that your actions will have a much larger impact on the crew. You are encouraged not to kill more than just your targets, and to escalate your antagonist activities in harmony with the crew's response.

  Examples include:
  - [color=#994444]Bad:[/color] Letting loose the singularity/tesla without the objective to 'die a glorious death' (commonly abbreviated as 'DAGD'), or similar methods of stationwide destruction
  - [color=#994444]Bad:[/color] Heavily damaging/spacing or camping arrivals/cryosleep
  - [color=#994444]Bad:[/color] Unnecessarily extending the round
  - [color=#449944]Good:[/color] During a lowpop round, opting to purchase less powerful or more subtle gear as a traitor.

  ## Silicon

  [color=#a4885c]Silicons such as Cyborgs or the Station AI are a distinct role, not a substitute for a regular character.[color] You may choose to create a silicon character with a recurring personality or mannerisms, but these traits should never take precedence over silicon laws. Admins reserve the right to intervene in instances where they feel a silicon character has deviated from the spirit of the role to the detriment of intended silicon gameplay.

  - 1. Laws must be prioritized by their order.
  - 2. Laws can redefine terms used in other laws.
  - 3. You cannot request or actively seek out a law change.
  - 4. You are not required to follow orders which are extremely unreasonable.
  - 5. You must remain consistent with your interpretation of laws.
  - 6. Anyone who your HUD displays as having a crewmember's ID is crew. This may include antagonists, zombies, brigged prisoners, or Syndicate operatives with stolen IDs.
  - 7. Harm refers to physical harm, prioritized by immediacy and likelihood.
  - 8. You may determine how you resolve conflicts between orders.
