  # Welcome To Devilstation

  What roleplay level is it? It's just Roleplay. You know how to do it.
  
  Need something? Confused? AHELP. We generally will grant whatever you ask for, so long as it helps bring a bit of comedy to the round, or if it helps you with a gimmick you're going with.
  
  # Da Rules
  
  ## Before AHELPing for a rule break, consider:
  
  - People make mistakes. 
  
  - The round is not done. 
  
  - Things can change at the blink of an eye, and you should always at the very least assume someone is trying their best. Be fair to others.
  
  ## (1). Watch your mouth.
  
  - Don't use slurs or derogatory language, fictional or not.
  
  ## (2). Keep things entertaining.
  
  - The point of playing on this server is to experience, and create, a fun and entertaining story.
  
  - Killing someone or welderbombing security for no reason is not interesting.
  
  - Making the perfect plan and killing your target as an antagonist is not interesting for anyone but you.
  
  - Your actions should make the game more interesting for EVERYONE, and if done right, that should all come back to you as an entertaining and satisfying round.
  
  ## (3). Don't take things too serious.
  
  - Space Station 14 is a game where absurd things can happen. Clowns are hired on the station for God's sake. 
  
  - Overly serious characters are not fun to roleplay around.
  
  ## (4). No erotic content.
  
  - Our server only allows players who are at least 16 years of age or older. As such, we do not want any form of erotic content here.
