  # Engagement with Other Players

  ## CONSENT
  This is the absolute most important consideration to make. While this predominantly applies to romance roleplay, it is equally important to consider for other circumstances.
  When pre-planning a [color=ffa500]bit[/color] or pursuing multi-round roleplay with another character, always check in and make sure the other player is aware of your plan and is interested in participating.

  [color=#994444]Do not[/color] surprise people with romance rp. For example, before planning an in character date or confession of feelings, ask the other player involved.

  [color=#994444]Do not[/color] surprise people with grudges and rivalries that result in persistent negative interactions between characters. For example, two characters who consistently have verbal altercations or interpersonal conflicts outside of antagonist roleplay.

  Utilize pre round OOC chat, the discord server, or DMs to be certain the other player is open to roleplaying these with you.

  When pre-planning a bit that involves another player and/or their character make sure you get their permission before going ahead with it.

  Examples of when you should get consent before engaging include but are not limited to:
  - Making kodepiiae copies of another player's character.
  - Creating relatives of another player's character.
  - Anything relating to romance, rivalries, or grudges between two or more characters.

  Always remember you have multiple tools available to check in with people, and it is vital that you use them.

  The most prominent and immediate tool to use is LOOC chat to check in with another player in the moment and tell them if you are okay with an interaction or want it to stop.

  OOC is also available between rounds and a great tool for coordinating quick and loose plans for an interaction such as teaching someone a role or letting two characters meet.

  The Impstation Discord or your Discord DMs are other places you can coordinate. While we encourage spontaneity and the stories that arise from it, there are times when a more detailed discussion is needed. This is especially useful in a case like character romance where detailed consent is vital between players.

  In the event that a player does not respond well to a check in and continues involving you in something you did not and do not consent to, you ALWAYS have the ability to ahelp or send a modmail and have admin assistance in resolving the situation. Games are meant to be fun, if another player's actions are going beyond what is acceptable, the admin team is there to help.

  ## What is a bit?
  A bit is a series of actions strung together, almost always but not universally in the service of comedy.

  An example of a bit would be a mime spending a round constructing comedic nonlethal traps for other players to get caught in, or a clown who will consistently make large messes and comedically blame other players for doing so.

  Essentially, if you are spending effort to string together jokes and elements of your behavior for a consistent effect, that is a bit.

  ## Consent to antagonist actions
  Antagonists are a key part of the Impstation server. By playing on this server you inherently consent to interactions with those playing antagonists.
  Impstation does not operate on opt-in or opt-out for antagonist targeting. Everyone playing in the round has the potential to be targeted.

  However, if you believe an antagonist is going beyond what is appropriate you are encouraged to use LOOC or ahelp about it.

  These actions are purely in character and part of the game. No part of an antagonist's actions reflect the player's beliefs, actions, or feelings. No malice should be attributed to antagonist players for the actions they take as part of the game so long as they are within server rules.

  [color=#a4885c]Examples of what you may encounter with antagonists[/color]
  - Verbal harassment
  - Lies about your in-character traits and/or actions
  - Stalking
  - Sabotage
  - Physical assault
  - Stripping your equipment, including your jumpsuit

  ## Romance Rules
  Romance roleplay is welcome in this community and because of that it is important to make clear the boundaries on what is and is not acceptable.
  When participating in romance roleplay, always keep in mind that your interactions are visible to the entire server whether it be via ghost observation, admin tools, or replays of rounds. Conduct yourself as if you are 100% visible to everyone on Impstation, because you are.

  It is [color=#449944]acceptable[/color] to roleplay romance between characters, it is [color=#994444]not acceptable[/color] to repeatedly and habitually ignore other aspects of the game to engage with said romance roleplay.

  It is [color=#994444]not acceptable[/color] to excessively roleplay amorous physical interactions. We do not want to see descriptions of whether or not your kiss is using tongue, or if your significant other has particularly soft skin.

  [color=#a4885c]Examples of acceptable romance roleplay[/color]
  - Giving a brief kiss
  - Hugging
  - Speaking briefly in private and ending the conversation with a hug or a kiss
  - Going on in-game dates which do not take up the majority of the round or neglect job duties
  - Holding public weddings between characters in the game
  - Having a falling out when one character is an antagonist

  [color=#a4885c]ExamplesExamples of unacceptable romance roleplay[/color]
  - Threatening or being rude to people who interrupt romance RP
  - Detailed descriptions of kisses or other physical interactions including but not limited to groping, ass slapping, cuddling, and lap sitting
  - “Borderline” interactions are also included in this, if it is an interaction with the goal of titillation or sexual tension between characters, it is [color=#994444]not acceptable[/color]. Examples of this include but are not limited to physical restraints in private rooms, instructing another character to behave as a pet, and stepping on other characters.
  - In general, avoid fetish roleplay and references. Jokes are one thing, engaging in a fetish is another. Exercise your judgement, if you think you could be touching on roleplaying your own or someone else's fetish, stop immediately and move on to roleplay that is appropriate for a non-ERP environment.
  - Sexual interactions including the nonphysical such as dirty talk or referring to sex that may take place off station or out of game.
  - Isolating yourselves away from the station in order to go on dates while having job duties to attend ,
  - Especially in the case of heads of staff or other critical jobs.

  # Other Relationship Roleplay
  While the focus of this segment is on romance roleplay, it is worth noting that any persistent relationship between characters should be approached with the same sensitivity and consideration.

  Rivalries and grudges are an example of relationship roleplay which, while not romantic, requires a comparable level of consent between players and respect for the rules of the server.

  ## Character Backstory
  Utilizing backstory found outside of the game should always be an opt-in experience. Using backstory to surprise players, especially when they are not aware you will do so, is poor etiquette and likely to be a frustrating and unfun experience.

  An [color=#449944]acceptable[/color] example of opting in to using backstory in game is pre-planning that a character will bring it up at some point when two characters interact.

  It is [color=#449944]acceptable[/color] to bring up off-station aspects of your character's life such as their hobby, background, job history, or various other details that may arise organically.

  It is [color=#994444]not acceptable[/color] to behave aggressively or dismissively when others do not know details of your background and do not act according to it.

  For example, expressing anger in dead chat that medical players did not follow your postmortem instructions is [color=#994444]not acceptable[/color].

  It is also [color=#994444]not acceptable[/color] to attack antagonists who have killed your character's significant other without following escalation.

  An [color=#994444]unacceptable[/color] example would be surprising a paradox clone with a quiz on information from a character's backstory. This is not fun or fair for a player who was not able to choose who they would be a clone of and did not plan on researching a character's backstory ahead of time.

  ## “Yes, and” and “No, but”
  Typically “Yes, and” and “No, but” are applied to improvisational comedy, but they work just as well as guidance for a roleplay environment. These are reliable methods used to continue roleplay with others throughout your gameplay. Many otherwise boring or directionless interactions can become surprisingly fun and memorable through using these methods.

  Both of these are fundamentally continuations of the conversation. “Yes, and” affirms the first statement and expands on it. “No, but” rejects it and provides an alternative. These are tools used to engage with the events around you and provide a springboard to move forward with roleplay.

  Don't be afraid to take conversations and scenes in new or unexpected directions, good improv always begins small before building up to something greater. Sometimes you may fumble a joke or make someone uncomfortable, this happens to everyone and in the worst cases you can apologize through LOOC.

  [color=#a4885c]Examples of “Yes, and”[/color]
  - Two characters enter their shared workspace. One greets the other with "Good Morning!" And the other responds with "Everyone's so damn chipper these days..." and emotes a lazy wave.
  - A paradox clone walks up to the person they are a clone of and says, “Hey, I went ahead and returned that video we rented.” And the original responds, “NO! I haven't finished watching that!”
  - A crowd of people are gathered talking. One of them tells an embarrassing story (made up by the player on the spot) about another one. The person in question begins to stammer and get flustered while making excuses for whatever it was that happened.

  [color=#a4885c]Examples of “No, But”[/color]
  - A crewmate approaches the engineering counter and asks for a pair of welding goggles. The engineer at the counter refuses to give them goggles but offers a welding mask instead.
  - Three doctors are standing in the morgue discussing the soul alarms on the morgue caskets. One says to the others, “You know, these things just check for brain activity. Souls aren't real.” The other two turn to the first and insist that souls are a real known scientific quantity and proceed to engage in a discussion on the subject.
  - The captain made a ridiculous new law for the crew to follow. You refuse to participate but make it a point to playfully taunt and mock those that do, especially the captain

  # Engagement with The Game
  ## LRP Limitations
  Powergaming, or playing with the goal of using the most optimal methods possible within the game to the exclusion of all other pursuits, is not appropriate in our MRP setting.  This is not a limitation on being a skilled player, but rather a limit on ignoring roleplay and deeper engagement with other players in favor of “winning”.

  [color=#a4885c]Unacceptable LRP behavior[/color]
  - Playing as a station engineer and refusing to allow other engineers to participate in setting up the engine while you create the most optimal setup possible.
  - Refusing to teach an intern to play chemistry because you are focused on creating full bags of chemicals as quickly as physically possible.
  - Expecting botanist characters to solely focus on growing the most optimal plants for medical and getting upset when they focus on any other aspect of botany.
  - In general, getting mad at other players for not following optimal methods in their gameplay of any role.
  - or the opposite, getting mad or giving up when other players are more skilled or knowledgeable at the game.

  ## HRP Limitations
  Roleplay is a major part of this server, but it is important to know that this is medium roleplay rather than high roleplay, there should be a balance between your focus on gameplay and your focus on roleplay. You should not focus on roleplay to the exclusion of other aspects of the game.
  - For example, spending an entire round bolted in a dorm room to play out a scene without engaging with your job or any aspect of the round outside of it.

  Engaging with roleplay is part of this game, but there is a limit on what is appropriate to portray. The goal of limiting HRP behavior is not to punish detailed roleplay, rather to limit the presence of elements that are especially upsetting or exclusive to other players.

  It is acceptable to behave seriously and roleplay out serious subject matter provided it is done with acceptance that this is primarily a comedic environment and with consideration for if it may be upsetting or triggering to those around you.

  Even within a comedic environment you are still obligated to behave appropriately and be sensitive to those around you. Making jokes at the expense of marginalized people is still [color=#994444]not acceptable[/color] per the rules of the server.

  ## The Law Of Funny
  If you are approaching these subjects with levity and a comedic tone then there is room for flexibility. However, tread lightly and be mindful of others.
  - A gray obsessed with a cigarette brand does not fall under realistic addiction roleplay.
  - Sobbing face down at the bar and cursing out Pun Pun because he spilled your favorite drink.
  - Spilling out a traumatic backstory that incorporates a detail which recontextualizes it in an absurd way. “My family died in a brutal crash with a clown shuttle and I've been depressed ever since. I've never seen so many dead clowns.”

  [color=#a4885c]Unacceptable HRP behavior[/color]
  - Realistic addiction roleplay
  - Habitually roleplaying drinking yourself to death or having a dependence on substances to function, including depiction of withdrawals and agitation when going without said substance.
  - Behaving aggressively towards other characters in order to obtain substances.
  Realistic depictions of suicidality and suicide
  - Roleplaying out despondency in response to the death of an in-character partner culminating in writing a note and committing suicide.
  - Realistic depictions of bigotry
  - For example, invoking real stereotypes surrounding minority groups while roleplaying conflict between characters.
  - It is also [color=#994444]unacceptable[/color] to roleplay fictional bigotry between characters.
  - Depictions of sexual trauma
  - For example, describing in detail abuse a character underwent in the past
  - Reacting to another character's actions as if they are done with the motivation to sexually harass or assault your character.

  # Managing Your Out Of Character Emotions

  ## Distance Between IC actions and OOC emotions
  The actions taken between characters do not reflect out of character intent, it is important to maintain some distance between yourself and your character to have the best experience with the game.

  In character conflict does not reflect out of character conflict. If you are uncomfortable with an interaction, LOOC check-ins are the best method to diffuse potential tension. If issues persist or check-ins are not viable then press f1 to ahelp and contact admins to resolve the situation.

  Always assume those you interact with have good intentions and are there to have fun and enjoy the game with you. Projecting onto people that they are treating you with malice or the intent to ruin the game for you will always sour your experiences and overall make the game feel worse to play. This includes players you have had negative experiences with in the past, positive interactions can only begin in earnest when both of you allow it to. Always act in good faith and report bad actors to admins when issues arise.

  [color=#449944]Good:[/color]
  - You were killed by an antagonist, so you laugh about it and move on.
  - Security catches you as an antagonist, so you playfully taunt them or give an evil speech.
  - Someone in your department takes over a task you really wanted to do, so you ask if you can help them.
  - You're playing a rude character and want to establish two characters as disliking each other, so you message the other player to ask if they'd be okay with that.
  - Your body rots due to others overlooking it in a chaotic situation, so you accept the circumstances and move on.

  [color=#994444]Bad:[/color]
  - You were killed by an antagonist, so you take this as a personal insult and complain about them in deadchat.
  - Security catches you as an antagonist, so you yell at them, and call them shitsec over the radio.
  - Someone in your department takes over a task you really wanted to do, so you complain about them over the radio and refuse to interact with them.
  - You're playing a rude character, so you use that as an excuse to vent your OOC emotions and insult players for perceived slights.
  - Your body rots due to others overlooking it in a chaotic situation, so you take this as a sign that no one cares about you.

  ## Interruptions to Roleplay
  Interruptions are part of this game. You could be having a discussion where you disclose your dramatic past you've been building up to revealing over time when at any moment a wizard suddenly bursts in and kills you instantly. This is unavoidable and part of what makes this game so fun. It is important that you be open to this unpredictable nature and not be distressed and upset when it happens to you. Momentary emotions are part of life, but if you find yourself genuinely upset for extended periods when your roleplay is interrupted then you should take a break to cool down. If you have repeated difficulties recovering from being upset by in-game actions and events, it could better serve you to find a space where you can enjoy roleplay without the randomness and interruptions inherent to Space Station 14.

  Antagonists are crucial to this game. As wonderful as it is when roleplay with an antagonist goes well, there is nothing wrong with getting snuck up on and killed suddenly. You are not always owed a full scene with an antagonist before you die to them, and if you find yourself feeling enraged or distraught when an antagonist kills or otherwise executes their goals relating to your character, you would likely be more comfortable roleplaying in another medium.

  ## Playing to Win
  Space Station 14 is a game with no win state and should be approached as such. All should keep in mind that whatever your goal may be in a round they are secondary to keeping the round moving and having fun.
  - Antagonists should keep in mind that the goals given to them by the game are more like prompts than direct objectives. They should make an attempt to complete them but are not strictly required to do so. An antagonist who achieves none of their goals while creating an interesting and fun round dynamic with their tools and freedom is no less successful than an antagonist who achieves each goal set for them.
  - Antagonists should not utilize powergaming to achieve their goals. Hyper efficient plans with minimal risk are not engaging or particularly interesting for other players. As an antagonist you have more control over the pace and direction of the round, this does not make you the main character of the station.
  - Unless it is explicitly your objective, living through the round is not success. Reaching CentComm is not the primary goal of the crew and you should engage as much as possible with the ongoing round. Making the decision to attempt escape or the decision to escalate with antagonists and to save yourself or others' lives are both equally compelling narratives to roleplay through as long as you are active and engaged in the events.
