Pain management is an important part of surgery, as excessive pain will cause your patient to go into cardiac arrest.

When powered, operating tables can entirely suppress your patients' ability to feel pain.

Nitrous oxide can also be used for anesthesia.

When none of the above are available, normal painkillers are an option.

## Performing Surgery

In order to conduct surgery, your patient must not have any clothing obstructing them, and must be laying down.
