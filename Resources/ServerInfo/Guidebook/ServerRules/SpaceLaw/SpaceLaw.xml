  # Space Law
  In [italic]Space Station 14[/italic], stations operate under [bold]abbreviated space law[/bold], a set of rules for station governance and workplace safety put in place by Nanotrasen, and enforced by the tireless forces of [color=#cb0000]Security[/color].

  [bold]All crew members, passengers, and visitors aboard a station are expected to follow these laws.[/bold] It is the job of [bold]Lawyers[/bold] and the [bold]Warden[/bold] to act as station legal counsel, and it is the [color=#1b67a5]Captain[/color], [color=#cb0000]Head of Security[/color] (HoS), and [color=#cb0000]Warden[/color]'s jobs to ensure space law is followed and honored by all involved in criminal proceedings.

  The goals of a set of laws like this are to ensure the equitable treatment of all staff; to ensure the continued, safe operation of a station and her activities; and to administer the commensurate punishment of any dangerous, severe, or seditious acts committed.

  Space Law is importantly not part of the [textlink="server rules" link="darules"]. However, some rules reference Space Law and require it to be followed by certain people or to some degree.

  This guidebook page offers an [italic]overview[/italic] of the regular and irregular procedures involved in upholding Space Law, which crew members must be aware of and can be subject to.

  ### Exceptions

  These laws are waived for [bold]foreign invaders[/bold], such as nuclear operatives, ninjas, and pirates, who are not governed by space law procedure and litigation. As always, security should follow orders by Command personnel and standard alert procedure when it comes to threats beyond space law.

  Traitors (typically employees or visitors) are [italic]not[/italic] considered foreign invaders, so their conduct is considered under space law -- if they violate the rules, they must be treated in accordance with them.

  ## Search and Seizure
  A [italic]personnel search[/italic] is a seizure of the objects in a person's backpack, hands, coat, belt, and pockets. If any [color=red]contraband items[/color] are found during a search, the officer may choose to either further the search into a detainment, or simply confiscate the restricted items. After the search is conducted, all legal items are to be returned to the person.

  A crewmate may legally decline any search conducted without probable cause or a warrant while the alert level is [color=#7cfc00]Code Green[/color]. It should be noted that if the alert level is [color=#0000bb]Code Blue[/color] or above, all personnel searches are legal.

  A [italic]departmental search[/italic] is the sweep of an entire area or department for contraband. It is recommended that the officers be extremely thorough, checking all lockers, crates, and doors. These can only be done with permission or, ideally, a warrant signed by the department head or highest-ranking Command staff, which is the [color=#1b67a5]Captain[/color] in most cases.

  ## Crimes
  All acts on the [textlink="Crime Listing" link="SpaceLawCrimeList"] are to be considered illegal by the purposes of this list.

  ## The Rights of Prisoners
  [bold]Prisoners have rights[/bold] that must be upheld by station security:
  - Prisoners must be granted adequate access to [color=#5b97bc]medical care[/color].
  - Prisoners must be allowed access to [bold]basic communications equipment[/bold] (i.e. radios) so long as they are not abused.
  - Prisoners must be granted [bold]clothing, food, water, shelter and safety[/bold]. If the brig is no longer safe, confinement must be established in another location.
  - Prisoners must be given access to [bold]legal counsel during an interrogation[/bold] if requested and available.
  - Prisoners must be given their shift-mandated PDA [italic]after confinement has finished[/italic], unless there is solid proof of PDA tampering. In that case, the PDA is to be secured (typically by the Head of Personnel) and replaced with a new unit.
  - Prisoners must be granted [bold]freedom of movement[/bold], and should not be restrained with handcuffs (or other devices) after being incarcerated, unless there is an [color=red]undue[/color] risk to life and limb. Similarly, any prisoners held for permanent confinement should be held in the communal brig, and should not be confined to a solitary cell unless they pose a risk to life and limb.

  ### Implantation
  Implants are technologies placed into the body using syringe-like implanters. These are difficult-to-remove, and are used both punitively by Security or for subterfuge by enemy forces.

  A [bold]prisoner in custody[/bold] can be subjected to [italic]implantation[/italic] procedures, within reason and should they meet appropriate circumstances. Just so, prisoners can also be asked to undergo [italic]implant extraction[/italic] for a specific implant, if there is reason to suspect it is implanted into them. The process of adding or extracting an implant should not prolong the detainee's sentence, meaning you can not hold them longer to perform the procedure, unless stated otherwise.

  As with any prisoner, implanted detainees must not be deprived of rights: [color=red]detainees may not be forced or coerced into performing implant extraction on themselves against their will.[/color]

  The following implants are commonly issued for use by Security, and have special circumstances applied to their use. Anything not in this list can be implanted, given legal pretext. If they give their clear permission, a prisoner can also receive implantation/extraction procedures [italic]without[/italic] meeting the circumstances for an implant.

  - [color=#a4885c]Tracking Implants:[/color] Trackers can be applied to any suspect that has been convicted of a violent crime (the red linked-crimes).
  - [color=#a4885c]Mindshields:[/color] Required for any members of Command and Security, mindshields protect the implantee from being converted by mind control or enemy forces. Mindshields can be administered to any inmate who has been clearly mind-controlled, lost control of themselves, or has been charged with unlawful control. Unlike other implants, you may prolong the detainee's sentence until you finish issuing a mindshield, so long as it's done in a timely fashion. If the suspect refuses to cooperate or the implant fails to function, they can be charged with Refusal of Mental Shielding.

  Usage of contraband implanters is a detainable offense, but it's [color=red]not reasonable[/color] to detain someone solely for having an [bold]unidentified[/bold] implant inside them.

  A former prisoner can also be asked to undergo implantation/extraction after their release from custody; if the special circumstance applied to the implant was met during imprisonment, the person must comply with the request.

  ## Punishments
  ### Standard Punishments
  - [color=#a4885c]Warning:[/color] For minor crimes, repair the issue, then [color=yellow]warn[/color] the person not to attempt the crime again. If they still proceed to do it at a later date, confinement may be more appropriate.
  - [color=#a4885c]Confinement:[/color] Confinement is an extremely typical punishment, holding the offender in a cell for an amount of time according to the crimes.
  - [color=#a4885c]Demotion:[/color] Entails removing all departmental gear they have on their person and revoking the involved department access off their ID. This requires the captain's or involved department head's approval. Demotions should only be issued if the person pose a threat to their own department or are in a position where they have/can abuse their job's gear to commit further crimes.

  ### Major Punishments
  - [color=#a4885c]Permanent Confinement:[/color] Permanent confinement refers to being held in the permanent brig for the remainder of the shift. A person is eligible for permanent confinement if their timed sentence would exceed 15 minutes. Any persons subject to this punishment are required to be transported in cuffs to CentComm at the end of the shift. A permanent prisoner should never be deprived of their rights.
  - [color=#a4885c]Execution:[/color] Execution is a humane way of dealing with extremely unruly crewmates. Within reason, a prisoner who has been given the death sentence may pick how they wish to be killed. Common methods are firing line, lethal injection, exile, or high voltage electrocution. Another alternate method of "execution" is the process of placing a staff's mind into a borg; this is allowed so long as it is lawful. Execution can only be issued with the authority of the Captain's approval; if the HoS is currently acting-captain, or there is no acting captain, all heads of staff are to hold a vote on the matter.

  ## Sentencing
  [bold][color=#7cfc00]Use common sense and humanity when issuing punishments.[/color][/bold]

  Always take in account the severity and only charge for what is needed for someone to learn their lesson. You do not have to always levy the highest punishment you can; you do not have to always give the maximum time or look to demote someone. Prisoners cooperating with Security and/or who are behaving well should have their sentences reduced.

  A member of Security informing at least the Warden of any sentence levied is considered [color=#7cfc00]good practice[/color], even for timed sentences. If one is available, a [bold]Lawyer[/bold] can be additionally consulted for concerns regarding sentencing.

  ### Inappropriate Sentencing
  Security officers are required ([color=red]by server rules[/color]) to only issue a sentence of permanent confinement [bold]whenever space law would allow permanent confinement[/bold] (whenever total confinement length would be anything longer than 15 minutes). Beyond this requirement, inappropriate sentence lengths are an in-character decision by the officer, [i]not[/i] a failure to follow server rules.

  As stewards of the station, the [color=#1b67a5]Captain[/color], [color=#cb0000]Head of Security[/color], and/or [color=#cb0000]Warden[/color] are responsible, within reason, for ensuring security officers place appropriate sentences that follow space law. However, if these crew members become aware of any inappropriate sentencing, including excessively-long or non-commensurate sentences, and if there is not an urgent threat or danger that they must prioritize, then [bold]they must work to correct that sentence[/bold].

  [italic]Unreasonable failures of these crew members to ensure space law is followed, as determined by game admins, will be considered a [color=red]failure to follow server rules[/color].[/italic]

  ### Linked Crimes & Stacking Sentences
  If you charge someone with two or more different crimes at the same time, oftentimes, you should [color=#a4885c]combine the sentences[/color] you would give them for each crime.

  Certain crimes are [italic]linked crimes[/italic], shown in matching colors and suffixes on the [textlink="Crime Listing" link="SpaceLawCrimeList"]. These [color=red]can not be stacked[/color] and instead override each other. You should pick the highest crime that matches the case when considering sentencing.

  For example...
  - A suspect has committed a 2-01 (possession: major) and a 3-01 (possession: syndicate). The maximum sentence here would be 10 minutes due to them being linked crimes, and 3-01 is the greater crime.
  -  A suspect commits a 3-04 (Secure trespassing) and a 3-06 (manslaughter). Those crimes stack since they are not linked crimes. You could sentence for a maximum of 20 minutes, but context matters heavily, and maximum sentences should only be used for the worst offenders.

  ### Repeat Offenses
  [color=#a4885c]Repeat offenses[/color] are when a person is sentenced and released for a crime, and then goes to commit the [bold]same crime within the same shift[/bold]. The severity of a repeat offense should affect later sentencing, adding extra time to confinement as punishment for repeatedly showing a disregard for space law.

    - [color=#a4885c]Second time offending[/color]: +3 minutes
    - [color=#a4885c]Third time offending[/color]: +6 minutes
    - [color=#a4885c]Fourth time offending[/color]: permanent confinement.

  It should be noted each tacked-on time is directly linked to one type of crime, so for example, if someone does their first repeat of trespass and petty theft, you can charge them with an extra 6 minutes.

  ### Inchoate Offenses
  An [color=#a4885c]inchoate offense[/color] is any crime committed while preparing for or seeking to commit another criminal act, without the necessity of the act being successful or committed at all.

  A person should be charged if they intentionally, knowingly, and substantially:
    - assist someone else in committing a crime (becoming an accessory)
    - make a solid attempt to commit an illegal act (attempting)
    - express a clear desire to commit a crime (criminal intent)

  For any crime which has an [italic]attempted[/italic] listing in the Crime List (i.e. murder), these inchoate offenses are charged under that listing. Otherwise, charge inchoate offenders [bold]as though they committed the offense[/bold].

  For example...
  - an engineer giving another person tools after learning they are going to break into a restricted area would be charged for that act.
  - a Syndicate operative who attempts to arm the station's nuke can still be sentenced accordingly for terrorism, even if the nuke was disarmed.
